# Mathematical-Modelling-of-Cholera-Transmission-in-South-Africa-2000-01
This project explores the dynamics of the 2000-2001 cholera outbreak in South Africa using a mathematical model based on an extended SIR framework. Data from the World Health Organization was analyzed to identify trends in infections and fatalities. The project implements a compartmental model to simulate disease progression and evaluates the impact of public health interventions such as improved sanitation, safe drinking water, and food hygiene. Using MATLAB, simulations were performed to assess the effectiveness of control measures, visualize trends, and conduct sensitivity analyses to identify critical parameters influencing disease spread. The results highlight the importance of integrated public health strategies in mitigating cholera outbreaks and reducing mortality rates.
